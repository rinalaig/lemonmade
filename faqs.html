						<p>Specifically prohibited from organic crops are genetically modified organisms (GMO), irradiation, and the use of sewage sludge; all three practices are permissible in conventional agriculture. The USDA requires farms and production facilities, except for very small farms, to be certified organic before their products can claim to be organic. The LemonMade Farms takes great care to provide products that are made with high-quality ingredients. We verify that suppliers of our organic raw materials meet the requirements of the National Organic Program. The LemonMade farms and Fresh and Organic LemonMade Company is proud to be an official participant of The Non-GMO Project. For more information about The Non-GMO Project or to view our entire list of verified products to date, visit <a href="www.nongmoproject.org">www.nongmoproject.org</a>.

					Organic Products Meet Stringent Standards: Organic certification is the public's assurance that products have been grown and handled according to strict procedures. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's certified organic seal lets consumers know which products are certified organic, and assures them that the products have met government standards.
					</p>

					<p>Organic Food Tastes Great: It's common sense: Well-balanced soils grow strong, healthy plants, which grow great tasting food!</p>

					<p>Organic Farms Respect Our Water Resources: The reduction of polluting chemicals and nitrogen leaching, done in combination with soil building, protects and conserves water resources.</p>

					<p>Organic Farmers Work in Harmony with Nature: Soil is the primary focus of organic farming. By building soil, organic growers help prevent soil erosion.</p>

					<p>Organic Producers Are Leaders in Innovative Research: Organic farmers have led the way, largely at their own expense, with innovative on-farm research aimed at minimizing agriculture's impact on the environment.</p>

					<p>Organic Producers Strive to Preserve Diversity: The loss of a large variety of species (biodiversity) can have unforeseen and detrimental effects on our environment. Organic farmers and gardeners have been collecting and preserving seeds, and growing unusual varieties for decades.</p>

					<p>Organic Farming Helps Keep Rural Communities Healthy: Organic farming may be one of the few survival tactics left for the family farm and the rural community. By choosing organic practices, farmers create a value-added product that can be sold at a premium.</p>	

					<p>Organic Is Abundant: Now most food categories have organic alternatives. And nonfood agricultural products are being grown organically - even cotton, which most experts felt couldn't happen.</p>

					    <p>During the harvest, the ripened fruit is picked, thoroughly washed and pressed into juice. The fruit juice is concentrated by being placed in a low-pressure chamber, which draws off water with a minimum application of heat. The fruit essence is captured and returned to the concentrate from the water vapor. This preserves the aroma and flavor of the fruit. The LemonMade Farms adds only a minimal amount of water to the juice concentrates to reconstitute them into whole fruit juice.

			        <p>There are two reasons we use fruit juice concentrates:</p>
			        <ul>
			        	<li><p>Variety: Although The LemonMade Farms presses many fresh fruits into juice, the use of fruit juice concentrates has enabled us to offer a variety of innovative juice-blend flavors.</p></li>
						<li><p>Quality: Fresh and Organic LemonMade concentrates are produced when the desired fruits are at their best quality. This allows The LemonMade Farms to combine Oregon-grown lemons that are at their peak of perfection in June with California-grown lemons that are ripe in September.</p></li>
